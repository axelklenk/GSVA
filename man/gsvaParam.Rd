\title{Construct a \code{GSVA} parameter object}
\usage{
gsvaParam(
  exprData,
  geneSets,
  kcdf = c("Gaussian", "Poisson", "none"),
  tau = 1,
  maxDiff = TRUE,
  absRanking = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprData}{The expression data.  Must be one of the classes
supported by \code{\linkS4class{GsvaExprData}}.}

\item{geneSets}{The gene sets.  Must be one of the classes supported by
\code{\linkS4class{GsvaGeneSets}}.}

\item{kcdf}{Character vector of length 1 denoting the kernel to use during
the non-parametric estimation of the cumulative distribution function of
expression levels across samples.  By default, \code{kcdf="Gaussian"} which is
suitable when input expression values are continuous, such as microarray
fluorescent units in logarithmic scale, RNA-seq log-CPMs, log-RPKMs or
log-TPMs.  When input expression values are integer counts, such as those
derived from RNA-seq experiments, then this argument should be set to
\code{kcdf="Poisson"}.}

\item{tau}{Numeric vector of length 1.  The exponent defining the weight of
the tail in the random walk performed by the \code{GSVA} (Hänzelmann et al.,
2013) method.  The default value is 1 as described in the paper.}

\item{maxDiff}{Logical vector of length 1 which offers two approaches to
calculate the enrichment statistic (ES) from the KS random walk statistic.
\itemize{
\item \code{FALSE}: ES is calculated as the maximum distance of the random walk
from 0.
\item \code{TRUE} (the default): ES is calculated as the magnitude difference between
the largest positive and negative random walk deviations.
}}

\item{absRanking}{Logical vector of length 1 used only when \code{maxDiff=TRUE}.
When \code{absRanking=FALSE} (default) a modified Kuiper statistic is used to
calculate enrichment scores, taking the magnitude difference between the
largest positive and negative random walk deviations. When
\code{absRanking=TRUE} the original Kuiper statistic that sums the largest
positive and negative random walk deviations, is used. In this latter case,
gene sets with genes enriched on either extreme (high or low) will be
regarded as ’highly’ activated.}
