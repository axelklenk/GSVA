\title{Construct a \code{ssGSEA} parameter object}
\usage{
ssgseaParam(exprData, geneSets, alpha = 0.25, normalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprData}{The expression data.  Must be one of the classes
supported by \code{\linkS4class{GsvaExprData}}.}

\item{geneSets}{The gene sets.  Must be one of the classes supported by
\code{\linkS4class{GsvaGeneSets}}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric vector of length 1.  The exponent defining the
weight of the tail in the random walk performed by the \code{ssGSEA} (Barbie et
al., 2009) method.  The default value is 0.25 as described in the paper.}

\item{normalize}{Logical vector of length 1; if \code{TRUE}  runs the \code{ssGSEA} method
from Barbie et al. (2009) normalizing the scores by the absolute difference
between the minimum and the maximum, as described in their paper. Otherwise
this last normalization step is skipped.}
}
\value{
A new \linkS4class{ssgseaParam} object.
}
\description{
Construct and return a new object of class \linkS4class{ssgseaParam}.
}
