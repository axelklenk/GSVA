\title{Compute gene-sets overlap}
\usage{
\S4method{computeGeneSetsOverlap}{list,character}(gSets, uniqGenes, minSize = 1, maxSize = Inf)

\S4method{computeGeneSetsOverlap}{list,ExpressionSet}(gSets, uniqGenes, minSize = 1, maxSize = Inf)

\S4method{computeGeneSetsOverlap}{GeneSetCollection,character}(gSets, uniqGenes, minSize = 1, maxSize = Inf)

\S4method{computeGeneSetsOverlap}{GeneSetCollection,ExpressionSet}(gSets, uniqGenes, minSize = 1, maxSize = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{gSets}{Gene sets given either as a \code{list} or a
\code{GeneSetCollection} object.}

\item{uniqGenes}{Vector of unique genes to be considered when calculating
the overlaps.}

\item{minSize}{Minimum size.}

\item{maxSize}{Maximum size.}
}
\value{
A gene-set by gene-set matrix of the overlap among every pair of
gene sets.
}
\description{
Calculates the overlap among every pair of gene-sets given as
input.

This function calculates the overlap between every pair of gene sets of the
input argument \code{gSets}. Before this calculation takes place, the gene
sets in \code{gSets} are firstly filtered to discard genes that do not match
to the identifiers in \code{uniqGenes}. Secondly, they are further filtered
to meet the minimum and/or maximum size specified with the arguments
\code{minSize} and \code{maxSize}. The overlap between two gene sets is
calculated as the number of common genes between the two gene sets divided
by the smallest size of the two gene sets.
