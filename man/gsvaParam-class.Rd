\description{
Method-specific parameters for the \code{GSVA} method.
}
\details{
In addition to the two common parameter slots inherited from
\verb{[GsvaMethodParam]}, this class has slots for the two method-specific
parameters of the \code{GSVA} method described below.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{kcdf}}{Character vector of length 1 denoting the kernel to use during
the non-parametric estimation of the cumulative distribution function of
expression levels across samples. \code{kcdf="Gaussian"} is suitable when input
expression values are continuous, such as microarray fluorescent units in
logarithmic scale, RNA-seq log-CPMs, log-RPKMs or log-TPMs. When input
expression values are integer counts, such as those derived from RNA-seq
experiments, then this argument should be set to \code{kcdf="Poisson"}.}

\item{\code{tau}}{Numeric vector of length 1.  The exponent defining the weight of
the tail in the random walk performed by the \code{GSVA} (Hänzelmann et al., 2013)
method.}

\item{\code{maxDiff}}{Logical vector of length 1 which offers two approaches to
calculate the enrichment statistic (ES) from the KS random walk statistic.
\itemize{
\item \code{FALSE}: ES is calculated as the maximum distance of the random walk from 0.
\item \code{TRUE}: ES is calculated as the magnitude difference between
the largest positive and negative random walk deviations.
}}

\item{\code{absRanking}}{Logical vector of length 1 used only when \code{mx.diff=TRUE}.
When \code{abs.ranking=FALSE} a modified Kuiper statistic is used to calculate
enrichment scores, taking the magnitude difference between the largest
positive and negative random walk deviations. When \code{abs.ranking=TRUE} the
original Kuiper statistic that sums the largest positive and negative
random walk deviations, is used. In this latter case, gene sets with genes
enriched on either extreme (high or low) will be regarded as ’highly’
activated.}
